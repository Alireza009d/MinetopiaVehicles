⚠️ EDIT THIS TEMPLATE AND REMOVE THIS MESSAGE WHEN YOU'RE DONE ⚠️ 

Hi, I would like to contribute to the plugin by offering you my `[YOUR LANGUAGE]` translation.

### I have:
- [x] attached the sole file to this issue (not a ZIP/RAR/...).
- [ ] attached edits to the LanguageUtils class (not mandatory but facilitates adding the language).
- [ ] made sure that the translation file is up to date.
- [ ] tested the translation with the latest plugin version - `[SPECIFY THE VERSION]`.
- [x] checked all the boxes (using [ ] or [x]) which apply.

### More info

You may add contact info which will be added to `credits.txt` and/or add further comments. (MTV Team decides which info is added to credits.txt)
